##====methods

##===counting
##==color selections
##counting formula for number of color selections given n colors and t atomic sets
##calculating size of atomic set given size of unions with other sets
##enumerating and counting the legal (and non-legal) configurations of sizes of unions between atomic sets
##given a set of observed unions between some number of atomic sets, calculate all possible color selections

##==partitioning
##calculate number of knot points per atom (via density and atom size)
##enumerate and count stirling sets

##==distribution
##count number of ways to distribute selected colors to a given parition of knot points

##==summing
##produce a (weighted) count of all maps given zero or more known unions between atomic sets (can be used for marginalization)
##set machinery for performing summations
  ##given specified interactions (unions) between atomic sets, enumerate the summands, their limits, and specify order of summation.


##===generation
##produce an object map given specified attributes
##produce an object map given specified attributes and some observed unions between atomic sets and some (optional) weighting function
